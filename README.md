# Capstone Engagement
Assessment, Analysis, and Hardening of a Vulnerable System

During the project, I played the role of a malicious actor to infiltrate the machine. Then I played the defensive security role by viewing, analyzing logs and determining best practices to protect the system.

The project explains the following:
1. Vulnerabilities of exploited of a Capstone VM.
2. Analysis of data viewing logs using Kibana.
3. Proposed mitigation strategies.
